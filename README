# uiki!

On a saturday morning, after looking for all over the internerds a wiki compiler similar to ikiwiki but with less dependencies and stuff to download and configure, since my "wiki" only had 6 pages, and didn't made any sense to me to download 6MB to write less than 20k on flat text files, I wrote this very simple wiki compiler.
I was heavily inspired by the entries listed on this ShortestWikiContest, so I had to make my smallish-wiki-compiler as small as possible.

That's the story, basically.
Oh, why didn't I used markdown?
Because sometimes I'm stubborn.

to other websites:
